# Rust client SDK for Mpl Project Name

An autogenerated Rust client SDK for the project.

## Getting started

From your project folder:

```bash
cargo add mpl-project-name
```

## Structure

The client SDK is divided into several modules:

- `accounts`: structs representing the accounts of the program
- `errors`: enums representing the program errors
- `instructions`: structs to facilitate the creation of instructions, instruction arguments and CPI instructions
- `types`: structs representing types used by the program

## Testing

To run the SDK tests, run the following from the root directory of the repository:

```bash
pnpm install
```

and then:

```bash
pnpm clients:rust:test
```
